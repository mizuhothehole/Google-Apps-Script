Hello world in apps script

The apps script is using the javascript as the programming language

function dsadsad() {
  Logger.log("Hello World!!");
}

Here it seems to be very kind for us.

After using "ctrl + enter", there came out something like a log:

[17-11-29 23:10:42:372 JST] Hello World!!

I am treating it as the macro of google.Also,I think it is like macro in macrosoft. Just for automatical office works.
Now it is supporting almost everything: like database, maps, mail, locations, file, translation and so on that the functions
Google provided to us. It is more friendly than macrosoft because it is using Javascript. Which is much more easier than the
VBA or VBS or VB...

You know it is not a good thing to debug in VBE. But it is much more easier to debug in IDE provided by google. Also we are 
using the services provided by macrosoft, and it is so wildly use so sometimes we have to use tech provided by macrosoft.
For further thinking. What can apps script do? It can do whatever the tranditional services that Google provided to us. Just like
that we can use some macros in Word or Excel. We can also use some functions provided by google.

Here is the point. The core of software is the "service".Which makes customers wants to use it. So above all, we can see almost 
all the services provided by these apis or these GUIs. They are just what they are. In the eyes of developers, these services 
are like apis. In usual users, they are just some GUIs. Anyway, after all, we are serving the society. So, we, developers are 
serving the society in some way everyday, which makes us having the worth to be alive.

So as in my eye, the bigger the company is, they sell service, not selling products. They serve society, not served by society.
